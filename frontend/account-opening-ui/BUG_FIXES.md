# Bug Fixes Applied - October 18, 2025

## Issues Reported

1. **Cannot see customers** - Customer list page not displaying data
2. **Cannot submit application after uploading passport document** - Document upload step blocking progression

---

## Root Causes Identified

### Issue 1: Customer List Not Displaying
**Root Cause:** Backend services are not running, causing API calls to fail with network errors.

**Why it happened:** The frontend React app runs independently on port 3000, but requires the backend microservices (running on ports 8081-8084) to fetch actual data.

### Issue 2: Document Upload Blocking Submission
**Root Cause:** The DocumentUploadStep component was not synchronizing its local state with the parent wizard component when documents were added or removed.

**Why it happened:** 
- When you clicked "Add Document", it updated only the local component state
- The parent wizard state was only updated when clicking "Next"
- This could cause confusion if users expected immediate validation or went back/forward between steps

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Enhanced Error Messages for Backend Connectivity

**File:** `src/pages/CustomerList.js`

**Changes:**
1. Improved error detection to identify network/connection errors
2. Added clear error message: "Cannot connect to backend server. Please start the backend services first."
3. Added helpful instructions directly on the error page showing:
   - How to start backend services
   - Which ports each service uses
   - Service URLs

**Before:**
```javascript
setError('Failed to load customers. Please try again later.');
```

**After:**
```javascript
const errorMessage = err.code === 'ERR_NETWORK' || err.message.includes('Network Error')
  ? 'Cannot connect to backend server. Please start the backend services first.'
  : 'Failed to load customers. Please try again later.';
setError(errorMessage);
```

### Fix 2: Real-time State Synchronization in Document Upload

**File:** `src/components/wizard/DocumentUploadStep.js`

**Changes:**

#### Change 1: Added useEffect for Data Synchronization
```javascript
// Added import
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// Added useEffect hook
useEffect(() => {
  if (data && Array.isArray(data)) {
    setDocuments(data);
  }
}, [data]);
```

**Benefit:** Ensures local state stays in sync when navigating back to this step

#### Change 2: Immediate Parent Update on Add
```javascript
// Before
setDocuments([...documents, newDoc]);

// After
const updatedDocuments = [...documents, newDoc];
setDocuments(updatedDocuments);
onUpdate(updatedDocuments); // âœ… Sync with parent immediately
```

**Benefit:** Parent wizard knows about documents immediately, not just when clicking "Next"

#### Change 3: Immediate Parent Update on Remove
```javascript
// Before
setDocuments(documents.filter((doc) => doc.id !== id));

// After
const updatedDocuments = documents.filter((doc) => doc.id !== id);
setDocuments(updatedDocuments);
onUpdate(updatedDocuments); // âœ… Sync with parent immediately
```

**Benefit:** Keeps wizard state accurate when deleting documents

#### Change 4: Safe Default Value
```javascript
// Before
const [documents, setDocuments] = useState(data);

// After
const [documents, setDocuments] = useState(data || []);
```

**Benefit:** Prevents errors if `data` is undefined

### Test 2: Customer List with Backend

**Without Backend Running:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/customers
2. âœ… Should see clear error message: "Cannot connect to backend server"
3. âœ… Should see instructions for starting backend services

**With Backend Running:**
1. Start all backend services (see BACKEND_STARTUP_GUIDE.md)
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/customers
3. âœ… Should see list of customers (or "No customers found" if database is empty)
4. Complete account opening wizard
5. Refresh customer list
6. âœ… Should see newly created customer

## How to Apply These Fixes

The fixes have already been applied to the source files. To see them in action:

### Option 1: Hot Reload (Automatic)
If your React dev server is still running, it should automatically reload with the changes.
- Just refresh your browser at http://localhost:3000

### Option 2: Restart React App
If hot reload doesn't work:
```powershell
# Stop the current React app (Ctrl+C in its terminal)
cd c:\genaiexperiments\accountopening\frontend\account-opening-ui
npm start
```
