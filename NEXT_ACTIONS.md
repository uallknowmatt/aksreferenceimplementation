# Post-Cleanup Action Items

## ‚úÖ Latest Fix Applied

**Issue**: "Resource already exists" error  
**Solution**: Added automatic resource import step to workflow  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed and pushed (commit 6d11899)

The workflow now automatically:
1. Checks if resources exist in Azure
2. Checks if they're in Terraform state
3. Imports them if needed
4. Proceeds with plan/apply

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Set Up GitHub Environment for Manual Approval

The workflow is now pushed and will run, but **production deployment will fail** until you set up the GitHub environment.

**Steps**:
1. Go to: https://github.com/uallknowmatt/aksreferenceimplementation/settings/environments
2. Click **"New environment"**
3. Name it: `production-approval` (exactly this name)
4. Click **"Configure environment"**
5. Check **"Required reviewers"**
6. Add yourself and/or team members who should approve production deployments
7. Click **"Save protection rules"**

**Detailed Instructions**: See `GITHUB_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`

### 2. Monitor the Current Workflow Run

The workflow was triggered by your push. Monitor it:

1. Go to: https://github.com/uallknowmatt/aksreferenceimplementation/actions
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Watch the dev deployment (should complete automatically)
4. The workflow will pause at "UAT Test Complete"
5. It will show an error because the environment doesn't exist yet

**Expected Behavior**:
- ‚úÖ Dev deployment will complete successfully
- ‚ùå UAT Test Complete will fail (environment not found)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Production deployment won't start

### 3. After Setting Up Environment - Re-run Workflow

Once you've created the `production-approval` environment:

1. Go to the failed workflow run
2. Click **"Re-run failed jobs"** OR
3. Click **"Re-run all jobs"**

**Expected Behavior**:
- ‚úÖ Dev deployment completes
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Workflow pauses at "UAT Test Complete" 
- üü° You see an approval request
- üë§ You approve the deployment
- ‚úÖ Production deployment proceeds

## Verification Steps

### After First Successful Run

1. **Verify Separate State Files**:
   ```bash
   # Check Azure Storage
   az storage blob list \
     --account-name tfstateaccountopening \
     --container-name tfstate \
     --output table
   ```
   
   You should see:
   - `dev.terraform.tfstate`
   - `prod.terraform.tfstate`

2. **Verify No "Resource Already Exists" Errors**:
   - Check workflow logs
   - Should show "Refreshing state..." not "Creating..."
   - No errors about resources already existing

3. **Verify Manual Approval Works**:
   - Push a small change (e.g., update a comment)
   - Watch dev deploy automatically
   - Confirm approval request appears
   - Approve and watch prod deploy

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Environment not found

**Error Message**: 
```
Error: The environment 'production-approval' does not exist
```

**Solution**: 
- Create the environment (see step 1 above)
- Make sure the name is exactly `production-approval`
- Re-run the workflow

### Issue: No approval request showing

**Possible Causes**:
1. Environment exists but no required reviewers configured
2. You're not added as a reviewer
3. Workflow hasn't reached that step yet

**Solution**:
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Environments ‚Üí production-approval
- Add required reviewers
- Save protection rules
- Re-run workflow

### Issue: "Resource already exists" error

**Error Message**:
```
Error: a resource with the ID "/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/rg-account-opening-dev-eus" already exists
```

**This shouldn't happen anymore**, but if it does:

**Solution**:
1. Check if backend init worked:
   ```bash
   # In workflow logs, look for:
   "Initializing Terraform with remote backend (dev environment)..."
   "terraform init -reconfigure -backend-config=key=dev.terraform.tfstate"
   ```

2. If backend init failed, check:
   - Storage account exists
   - Service principal has "Storage Blob Data Contributor" role
   - Backend configuration is correct

## Next Deployment Test

After everything is set up, test the full flow:

1. **Make a small change**:
   ```bash
   # Example: Add a comment to README.md
   echo "<!-- Test deployment flow -->" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Test: verify deployment flow"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor the workflow**:
   - Dev deploys automatically ‚úÖ
   - Workflow pauses at approval gate ‚è∏Ô∏è
   - Approval request appears üü°
   - You approve ‚úÖ
   - Production deploys ‚úÖ

3. **Verify results**:
   - Check both dev and prod AKS clusters
   - Verify services are running
   - Check separate state files in Azure Storage

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ GitHub environment created: `production-approval`  
‚úÖ Required reviewers configured  
‚úÖ Dev deployment completes automatically  
‚úÖ Approval request appears  
‚úÖ Able to approve for production  
‚úÖ Production deployment completes  
‚úÖ No "resource already exists" errors  
‚úÖ Separate state files (dev/prod)  

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the workflow logs in GitHub Actions
2. Review the error messages
3. Consult the documentation files
4. Verify Azure resources exist (storage account, etc.)
5. Check service principal permissions
