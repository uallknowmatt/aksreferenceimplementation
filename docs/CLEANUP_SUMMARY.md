# Cleanup and Consolidation Summary

**Date**: October 20, 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the major cleanup and consolidation effort performed on the Account Opening System codebase.

## Objectives

1. ✅ Consolidate dev and prod deployments into a single workflow with manual approval
2. ✅ Clean up all commented code blocks in Terraform files
3. ✅ Remove obsolete files (files with 'old' in the name)
4. ✅ Organize documentation - separate current from historical
5. ✅ Fix Terraform state backend configuration for proper state management

## Changes Made

### 1. Workflow Consolidation

**File**: `.github/workflows/aks-deploy.yml`

**Changes**:
- Merged production deployment into the main workflow
- Renamed jobs to be environment-specific:
  - `terraform-deploy` → `terraform-deploy-dev` and `terraform-deploy-prod`
  - `build-and-push` → `build-and-push-dev` and `build-and-push-prod`
  - `deploy-to-aks` → `deploy-to-aks-dev` and `deploy-to-aks-prod`
- Added manual approval gate: `uat-test-complete` job
  - Uses GitHub Environment: `production-approval`
  - Requires manual review before production deployment
- Updated all job dependencies to use environment-specific names
- Added 10-second warning before production apply

**Deployment Flow**:
```
Push to main
    ↓
Deploy to Dev (automatic)
    ↓
Build & Deploy Dev (automatic)
    ↓
UAT Test Complete (MANUAL APPROVAL)
    ↓
Deploy to Prod (after approval)
    ↓
Build & Deploy Prod (automatic)
```

### 2. Terraform State Backend Fix

**Problem**: Resources already existed but Terraform tried to create them again

**Root Cause**: Backend key was hardcoded to `dev.terraform.tfstate` in `main.tf`

**Solution**:

**File**: `infrastructure/main.tf`
- Removed hardcoded `key` from backend configuration
- Key now passed dynamically via `-backend-config`

**File**: `.github/workflows/aks-deploy.yml`
- Dev job passes: `-backend-config="key=dev.terraform.tfstate"`
- Prod job passes: `-backend-config="key=prod.terraform.tfstate"`

**Result**: Dev and prod now use separate state files, preventing conflicts

### 3. Terraform Code Cleanup

**Files Modified**:
- `infrastructure/iam.tf`
- `infrastructure/security.tf`
- `infrastructure/outputs.tf`

**Changes**:
- Removed all commented-out code blocks
- Kept only active, functional resources
- Removed historical notes about permissions and deprecated approaches
- Clean, maintainable code without clutter

**Removed Resources** (commented out):
- GitHub Actions Azure AD application
- Service principal password resources
- Management locks (require elevated permissions)
- Various role assignments requiring admin permissions
- Legacy OIDC setup outputs

**Kept Resources** (active):
- AKS kubelet identity ACR pull role
- Workload identity for application pods
- Federated identity credentials for K8s service accounts
- Essential outputs for workflow

### 4. File Cleanup

**Deleted Files**:
```
infrastructure/dev.tfvars.old
.github/workflows/aks-deploy-old.yml
.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml (merged into main workflow)
```

### 5. Documentation Reorganization

**Current Documentation Structure**:
```
/
├── README.md                          # Clean, current project overview
├── DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md                # Complete deployment guide
├── GITHUB_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md        # Manual approval setup guide
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── README.md                      # Infrastructure documentation
│   └── environments/
│       ├── README.md                  # Environment overview
│       ├── dev/
│       │   ├── terraform.tfvars
│       │   └── README.md              # Dev configuration
│       └── prod/
│           ├── terraform.tfvars
│           └── README.md              # Prod configuration
├── frontend/

└── pasthistory/
    ├── README.md                      # Historical docs index
    └── [40+ historical documents]
```

**New Files Created**:
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive deployment instructions
- `GITHUB_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` - Manual approval configuration
- `pasthistory/README.md` - Index of historical documents

**Updated Files**:
- `README.md` - Simplified and cleaned up, removed duplicates

### 6. README.md Cleanup

**Before**: 
- 950 lines
- Duplicate content
- Mixed old and new instructions
- Confusing structure

**After**:
- ~210 lines
- Single source of truth
- Clear structure
- Links to detailed guides
- Quick start section
- Deployment instructions
- Technology stack overview

## GitHub Environment Setup Required

To enable the manual approval for production deployments:

1. **Create Environment**:
   - Go to: Settings → Environments
   - Create: `production-approval`

2. **Configure Required Reviewers**:
   - Add authorized approvers
   - Save protection rules

3. **Test Approval Flow**:
   - Push a small change
   - Verify dev deploys automatically
   - Verify workflow pauses at approval gate
   - Approve and verify prod deploys

See `GITHUB_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify workflow syntax is valid
- [ ] Create GitHub environment: `production-approval`
- [ ] Configure required reviewers
- [ ] Test dev deployment (automatic)
- [ ] Test approval gate (manual)
- [ ] Test prod deployment (after approval)
- [ ] Verify separate state files (dev vs prod)
- [ ] Verify resources not recreated (state management works)

## Benefits

### After
- ✅ Single workflow file with clear dev/prod stages
- ✅ Dynamic backend keys prevent state conflicts
- ✅ Clean, maintainable Terraform code
- ✅ Organized documentation structure
- ✅ Clear separation of current vs historical docs
- ✅ Manual approval required for production
