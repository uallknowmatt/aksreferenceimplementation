## üöÄ Your Next Steps (Simple Version)

### Step 1: Install PostgreSQL (15 minutes)

1. **Download PostgreSQL 15:**
   - Go to: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
   - Click "Download the installer"
   - Choose Windows x86-64
   - Download PostgreSQL 15.x

2. **Run the Installer:**
   - Double-click the downloaded .exe file
   - Click "Next" through the setup
   - **Important:** When it asks for a password, use: `postgres`
   - Keep all default settings (port 5432, etc.)
   - Install all components (including pgAdmin and Stack Builder)
   - Wait for installation to complete

3. **Verify Installation:**
   ```powershell
   # Open PowerShell and run:
   Get-Service postgresql*
   
   # Should show "Running"
   ```

**If you get stuck:** See [POSTGRESQL_WINDOWS_SETUP.md](POSTGRESQL_WINDOWS_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

---

### Step 2: Create Databases (2 minutes)

1. **Open PowerShell in project directory:**
   ```powershell
   cd c:\genaiexperiments\accountopening
   ```

2. **Run the database setup script:**
   ```powershell
   .\setup-databases.ps1
   ```

3. **You should see:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ PostgreSQL found at: C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\bin
   ‚úÖ PostgreSQL service is running
   ‚úÖ Successfully connected to PostgreSQL
   ‚úÖ Database customerdb created successfully
   ‚úÖ Database documentdb created successfully
   ‚úÖ Database accountdb created successfully
   ‚úÖ Database notificationdb created successfully
   ```

**If there are errors:** The script will tell you what to fix.

---

### Step 3: Start Backend Services (3 minutes)

1. **In the same PowerShell window:**
   ```powershell
   .\start-all-services.ps1
   ```

2. **What will happen:**
   - Script checks PostgreSQL is running
   - Builds all 4 microservices
   - Opens 4 new PowerShell windows
   - Each window starts one service

3. **Wait for all services to start:**
   - Look at each of the 4 windows
   - Wait until you see messages like:
     ```
     Started CustomerServiceApplication in 12.345 seconds
     Started DocumentServiceApplication in 11.234 seconds
     Started AccountServiceApplication in 13.456 seconds
     Started NotificationServiceApplication in 10.987 seconds
     ```

4. **Keep all 4 windows open!** Don't close them.

**If a service fails to start:** Check that window for error messages. Common issue: PostgreSQL not running.

---

### Step 4: Start Frontend (2 minutes)

1. **Open a NEW PowerShell window**

2. **Navigate to frontend:**
   ```powershell
   cd c:\genaiexperiments\accountopening\frontend\account-opening-ui
   ```

3. **Start the React app:**
   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

4. **Wait for:**
   ```
   Compiled successfully!
   
   You can now view account-opening-ui in the browser.
   
     Local:            http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. **Browser should open automatically** to http://localhost:3000

**If browser doesn't open:** Manually go to http://localhost:3000

---

### Step 5: Test It! (5 minutes)

1. **You should see the home page with:**
   - Navigation bar at top
   - "Bank Account Opening System" heading
   - Blue "Open New Account" button

2. **Click "Open New Account"**

3. **Complete the wizard:**

   **Step 1 - Customer Information:**
   - First Name: `John`
   - Last Name: `Doe`
   - Email: `john.doe@example.com`
   - Phone: `555-0123`
   - Address: `123 Main St, City, State 12345`
   - Date of Birth: Pick any date
   - Click "Next"

   **Step 2 - Document Upload:**
   - Click "Choose File"
   - Select any PDF, JPG, or PNG from your computer
   - You'll see the file in the list
   - Click "Next"

   **Step 3 - Account Details:**
   - Account Type: Choose "Savings" or "Checking"
   - Initial Deposit: `1000`
   - Branch: `Main Branch`
   - Click "Next"

   **Step 4 - Review:**
   - Check that everything looks correct
   - Click "Submit Application"

4. **Success!** You should see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Application submitted successfully!
   Application ID: [some long ID]
   ```

5. **Verify data was saved:**
   - Click "Customers" in the top navigation
   - You should see John Doe in the list!
   - Click "Accounts" - you should see the new account
   - Click "Documents" - you should see the uploaded document

**üéâ Congratulations!** Everything is working!

## üß™ Optional: Verify Data in Database

Want to see the data in PostgreSQL?

### Option 1: Using pgAdmin (Visual)

1. Open pgAdmin (Start ‚Üí PostgreSQL 15 ‚Üí pgAdmin 4)
2. Enter master password if prompted
3. Expand "Servers" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL 15" ‚Üí "Databases"
4. Expand "customerdb" ‚Üí "Schemas" ‚Üí "public" ‚Üí "Tables"
5. Right-click "customer" ‚Üí "View/Edit Data" ‚Üí "All Rows"
6. You'll see John Doe's data!

### Option 2: Using Command Line

```powershell
psql -U postgres -d customerdb -c "SELECT * FROM customer;"
```

You'll see a table with John Doe's information.

---

## üîç Check Everything is Working

Run the health check script:

```powershell
cd c:\genaiexperiments\accountopening
.\check-services.ps1
```

**You should see:**
```
‚úÖ Customer Service: Running (http://localhost:8081)
‚úÖ Document Service: Running (http://localhost:8082)
‚úÖ Account Service: Running (http://localhost:8083)
‚úÖ Notification Service: Running (http://localhost:8084)
‚úÖ Frontend: Running (http://localhost:3000)
‚úÖ PostgreSQL: Running
```

All green checkmarks = Perfect! ‚úÖ

---

## üõë When You're Done Testing

### Stop Everything

1. **Stop Frontend:**
   - Go to the PowerShell window running `npm start`
   - Press `Ctrl+C`
   - Type `Y` when asked to terminate

2. **Stop Backend Services:**
   - Go to each of the 4 service windows
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in each one
   - Or just close all 4 windows

3. **PostgreSQL keeps running** (that's fine - you want it to stay running)

### Start Everything Again Later

Just run these two commands:

```powershell
# Start backend
.\start-all-services.ps1

# Start frontend (in new window)
cd frontend\account-opening-ui
npm start
```

Your data will still be there! PostgreSQL keeps it safe.

## ‚ùì What If Something Goes Wrong?

### PostgreSQL Won't Start
```powershell
Start-Service postgresql-x64-15
```

### "Port already in use" Error
```powershell
# Find what's using port 8081 (or whichever port)
netstat -ano | findstr :8081

# Kill it (replace 1234 with the PID from above)
taskkill /PID 1234 /F
```

### Services Won't Start
- Make sure PostgreSQL is running: `Get-Service postgresql*`
- Make sure you ran `setup-databases.ps1` successfully
- Check the service window for specific error messages

### Frontend Won't Start
- Make sure you're in the right directory: `frontend\account-opening-ui`
- Try: `rm -r -force node_modules; npm install`

### "Failed to load customers" Error
- Make sure all 4 backend services are running (check the 4 windows)
- Run `.\check-services.ps1` to verify
