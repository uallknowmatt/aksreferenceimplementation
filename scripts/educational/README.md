# Educational Scripts

This folder contains PowerShell scripts for **educational purposes and local development**. These scripts are **NOT required** for Azure deployment, as the GitHub Actions workflows handle everything automatically.

---

## üìö Purpose

These scripts help you:
- Understand how the system works locally
- Learn Azure CLI commands
- Test services on your local machine
- Manually interact with Azure resources (if needed)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### **For Azure Deployment:**
- ‚ùå **You don't need these scripts!**
- ‚úÖ **Use GitHub Actions workflows instead**
- ‚úÖ **Everything is automated in `.github/workflows/`**

### **For Local Development:**
- ‚úÖ **Use these scripts to test locally**
- ‚úÖ **Learn how components work**
- ‚úÖ **Debug issues on your machine**

## üöÄ Recommended Workflows

### For Production Deployment (Azure)

**Use GitHub Actions - Zero manual scripts needed!**

1. **Deploy Infrastructure:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/uallknowmatt/aksreferenceimplementation/actions
   - Run: "Deploy to AKS (Dev)" workflow
   - Result: Complete infrastructure + automated testing

2. **Start Infrastructure:**
   - Run: "Start Infrastructure (Dev)" workflow
   - Result: AKS and PostgreSQL started

3. **Stop Infrastructure:**
   - Run: "Stop Infrastructure (Dev)" workflow
   - Result: Infrastructure stopped (saves ~$52/month)

4. **Destroy Infrastructure:**
   - Run: "Destroy Infrastructure (Dev)" workflow
   - Result: All resources deleted

**No scripts needed!** ‚úÖ

---

### For Local Development

**Use these scripts or Docker Compose:**

#### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)
```powershell
# Start everything (databases + services)
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop everything
docker-compose down
```

#### Option 2: PowerShell Scripts
```powershell
# 1. Setup databases
.\setup-databases.ps1

# 2. Start all services
.\start-all-services.ps1

# 3. Check health
.\check-services.ps1

# 4. Start frontend (in another terminal)
cd ..\frontend\account-opening-ui
npm start
```

---

### For Learning Azure CLI

**Run scripts and read the code:**

```powershell
# Learn how to start infrastructure
.\start-infra.ps1

# Learn how to check status
.\check-infra-status.ps1

# Learn how to stop infrastructure
.\stop-infra.ps1

# Read the scripts to understand Azure CLI commands!
code start-infra.ps1
```

**Better:** Check the GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`) to see production-ready implementations

## üîß Script Maintenance

### These Scripts Are:
- ‚úÖ **Educational** - Learn Azure CLI and system architecture
- ‚úÖ **Optional** - GitHub Actions handle production deployments
- ‚úÖ **For Local Dev** - Test on your machine before deploying
- ‚úÖ **Documented** - Each script explains what it does

### These Scripts Are NOT:
- ‚ùå **Required for deployment** - Workflows handle that
- ‚ùå **Production tools** - Use workflows for production
- ‚ùå **Automatically updated** - Maintained as examples

---

## üí° Tips

1. **For Production:** Use GitHub Actions workflows exclusively
2. **For Learning:** Read these scripts to understand Azure CLI
3. **For Local Dev:** Use Docker Compose (easier than scripts)
4. **For Debugging:** Use `test-deployment.ps1` to check Azure deployment
5. **For Port-Forwarding:** Use `start-port-forwarding.ps1` to access AKS pods

---

## üÜò Need Help?

- **GitHub Actions Issues:** Check `.github/workflows/` and workflow logs
- **Local Development Issues:** Check `docker-compose.yml` or these scripts
- **Azure Issues:** Check `docs/` folder documentation
- **Script Issues:** Read the script code - it's well commented!

---

**Remember:** These scripts are **educational tools** and **local development helpers**. For production Azure deployments, always use the GitHub Actions workflows! üöÄ
